Bible Reading Plan for the Crossroads App

https://xr.church/static/app/readingplan/index.html

This very simple Javascript script dynamically generates a webpage with each day of the year and reading plan for each day. Each reading links to the YouVersion Bible app. The checkmarks are remembered in localStorage. The webpage will be embedded in the Crossroads app on its own tab.
